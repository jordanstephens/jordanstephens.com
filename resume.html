            <h2>Learning &amp; Personal Projects</h2>

            <p>I'm generally interested in software development, user experience, and design, but I have really enjoyed trying to fold my interests into one another over the last few years in the form of toy personal projects. I like to use these as opportunities to learn new technologies as well.</p>

            <hr />

            <p>I've been a musician for most of my life and I have enjoyed working on little toys to try to bring this interest together with my interest in making software for web browsers.</p>

            <h3>Mono</h3>

            <p>A monophonic synthesizer built with clojurescript and the Web Audio API.</p>

            <h3>Rp</h3>

            <hr />

            <p>I've also developed an interest in spaceflight and orbital mechanics over the last couple of years, and I hope to build more as I continue to explore that field.</p>

            <h3>Prograde</h3>

            <p>A visualizer for the ground paths of satellites with arbitrary orbital parameters.</p>
