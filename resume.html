            <li>Owned UX/UI and full stack development on application behind primary product</li>
            <li>Designed and implemented features to improve user experience, responding to user research:
              <ul>
                <li>Migrated an overwhelming, monolithic search flow to a few focused, simplified options to empower users with different lookup strategies and to reduce UI complexity</li>

            </li>

          <h2>Learning &amp; Personal Projects</h2>

          <p>I'm generally interested in software development, user experience, and design, but I have really enjoyed trying to fold my interests into one another over the last few years in the form of toy personal projects. I like to use these as opportunities to learn new technologies as well.</p>

          <hr />

          <p>I've been a musician for most of my life and I have enjoyed working on little toys to try to bring this interest together with my interest in making software for web browsers.</p>

          <h3>Mono</h3>

          <p>A monophonic synthesizer built with clojurescript and the Web Audio API.</p>

          <hr />

          <p>I've also developed an interest in spaceflight and orbital mechanics over the last couple of years, and I hope to build more as I continue to explore that field.</p>

          <h3>Prograde</h3>
