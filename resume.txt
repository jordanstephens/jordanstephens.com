---------

UX/UI, Full Stack Developer

MotoLogic is a tool used by automotive technicians to help diagnose and repair vehicle issues by providing manufacturer and after-market technical data and documentation on demand.

* Owned UX/UI and full stack development on application behind primary product
* Designed and implemented features to improve user experience, responding to user research:
  - Migrated an overwhelming, monolithic search flow to a few focused, simplified options to empower users with different lookup strategies and to reduce UI complexity
  - Built an interactive "zoom and pan" article viewer to allow users to see small details in schematics and diagrams
  - Added support for tablets and small screens, so users can take dynamic content with them to the engine block
* Worked to optimize performance and improve user experience on slow networks:
  - Simplified and consolidated content storage strategies to reduce lookup times
  - Implemented aggressive caching strategies
  - Reduced payload sizes of content and assets by improving data structures and formats
  - Moved subsequent view rendering to the client
* Pushed primary product refactoring and new development from monolithic Rails application to a "universal" React front-end to a (thin) Rails application shell around smaller, focused packages

Learning and Personal Projects
==============================

I'm generally interested in software development, user experience, and design, but I have really enjoyed trying to fold my interests into one another over the last few years in the form of toy personal projects. I like to use these as opportunities to learn new technologies as well.

I've been a musician for most of my life and I have enjoyed working on little toys to try to bring this interest together with my interest in making software for web browsers.

I've also developed an interest in spaceflight and orbital mechanics over the last couple of years, and I hope to build more as I continue to explore that field.
